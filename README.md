Hello! In this project weather application I've used Toastify, Tailwind, Luxon, uuid, Uil icons, React, and Open Weather API. 

This application uses https://openweathermap.org/api and their services to deliver weather information to you! Get your personal API-key there, it's free!

Once this key has been acquired, to properly use this React application, insert the key here to src/weatherService.js:

Your new API-keys take about 30-minutes to become online. Once your API-key works, the application will give you this screen after running: 
```
  npm start
```
on the terminal:

Weather will be different when you yourself run the application. 

Click the towns you see at the top or search for you own using city names. To get weather from your geolocation (if any exist), click this icon:

The application will notify you if it failed or succeeded. 

To change from Celsius to Fahrenheit, click F:

And congratulations! You know how to use this app!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
